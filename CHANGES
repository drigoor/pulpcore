0.10.4 (October 20, 2007)
  * Fixed Bug: double-clicking an empty TextField caused an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
    (tulsidas).
  * Tools: pulpcore_codebase can be defined for using a different codebase than the default.
    See the "project" template for an example.
  * Tools: pulpcore.js no longer allows Java 1.3 JREs to run PulpCore apps (Firefox issue).
  * Tools: pulpcore.js provides a better Java installation on Firefox.
  * Examples: templates now compile with source and target set to 1.4
  
0.10.3 (October 11, 2007)
  * Fixed Bug: isolated and created a workarounds for JavaSound pop/click bugs on both Mac and
    Windows. For Mac and Windows Java 1.4, the fix requires modifying the output sound, but it's 
    not noticable for most sounds. Another Windows fix - which existed in 0.8 but was incorrectly  
    removed from 0.9 - requires delaying a sound's playback by 10ms. A third fix exists only in
    Windows Java 5 or newer.
  * Applet Platform: sound is now muted gracefully when the app is exited.
  * Core: sound level and pan changes are now interpolated for more natural audio changes.
  * Core: updated default appearance of labeled buttons. See Button.createLabeledButton() and
    Button.createLabeledToggleButton().
  * Tools: PulpCorePlayer is more command-line friendly (setting Main-Class attribute in jar
    manifest) and it can now load PulpCore apps from the internet (only if the <applet> tag is 
    used - it can't load apps that use pulpcore.js)
  * API: TimelineEvent is now a Runnable, so the API is more familiar to Swing/AWT developers.
    Custom TimelineEvents will need to implement run() instead of trigger().
  * API: Added TimelineEvent.hasExecuted()
  * API: Added Scene2D.invokeLater(), invokeAndWait(), and addEventAndWait().
  * API: SoundClip data is now stored in little-endian byte order instead of big-endian. 
    (This only matters to developers doing sound synthesis or using Ogg Vorbis - be sure to get the 
    latest JOrbisAdapter.java in SVN).
  * API: Added TextField constructor: TextField(String text, int x, int y) which automatically 
    chooses a width and height.
  * API: Added Assets.getAssetNames()
  * Examples: Added MultiThreaded example
  
0.10.2 (September 14, 2007)
  * Examples: Added SoundEffects example
  * Tools: New audio formats: mono and stereo, 8000Hz, 11025Hz, 22050Hz, 44100Hz. WAV and AU
    file formats are supported. OGG is also supported if you have the jars (see the Wiki for info)
  * API: Added SoundSequence to play a sequence of sounds togther.
  * API: Both SoundClip and SoundSequence now extend the Sound base class. 
  * API: Added Sound.play(level, pan) to pan a sound clip.

0.10.1 (September 8, 2007)
  * Examples: Added Starfield example to demo mouse wheel rotation
  * Examples: All examples now have the default dimensions of 640x480.
  * API: Removed Group.commitChanges() (it was required in some circumstances, but using it
         was counter-intuitive, so the underlying algorithm was changed).
  * API: Added Input.getMouseWheelRotation(), Input.getMouseWheelX(), Input.getMouseWheelY(), and
         Sprite.isMouseWheelRotated()
  * API: Renamed:
         Stage.gotoInterruptedScene() -> Stage.popScene()
	 Stage.interruptScene() -> Stage.pushScene()
	 Stage.isInterrupted() -> Stage.canPopScene()
  * API: Added Stage.replaceScene() (sets the scene without clearing the scene stack)
  * Fixed Bug: possible NPE in Label if text is null.
  * Fixed Bug: Scene2D now saves the cursor state on hide.
  * Applet platform: Input.CURSOR_OFF now works.
  * Applet platform: distiction between left and right Alt, Shift, Control, and Meta keys.
  * Applet platform: distiction between mouse button 1, 2, and 3.
  * Applet platform: Added "Get Java" message for Java 1.3 or older.
  * Applet platform: Removed Java 1.1 classes ImageProducerScene, SunAudio, CoreAppletBeanInfo,  
    CoreApplet$COMClassObject.
  * Core: Now using the Java Collections framework (instead of Vector, Stack, Hashtable, and 
    Enumeration).
  * Core: Default font now has monospace numerals
  * Core: Changed version number to 0.10
  
  
== Version 0.9 (the last Java 1.1 compatible release) ==
  

0.9 b218 (September 4, 2007)
  * Examples: Example jar files in distribution archive are obfuscated - this brings the jar of 
    each example from 200K+ to about 84K. The total size of the distribution archive shrinks by 
    about 900K.
  * API: TextField.selectAll() is now public.
  * Player: CoreSystem.showDocument() now works under PulpCorePlayer.
  * Player: PulpCorePlayer can now open simple HTML files containing an applet tag (for Eclipse).
  * Player: PulpCorePlayer now has a File->Reload command. Tested in Eclipse Europa, 
    NetBeans 6, and jEdit 4.3/AntFarm 1.5. 
  * Fixed Bug: CoreSystem.print(Object)
  
0.9 b217 (September 1, 2007)
  * Examples: BubbleMark test now caps the frame rate by default.
  * Examples: build files can now optionally use applet parameters.
  * Examples: "project" template now accepts library jars in the lib folder.
  * API: Prevent instantiation of static classes Base64, CoreMath, PNGWriter, and StringUtil.
  * API: TextField.setText() is now public.
  * API: Added CoreSystem.getAppProperty() for applet parameters. Also the PulpCorePlayer and
    applet HTML generator were updated to accomodate. See the project template for an example.
  * API: Added several CoreSystem.print() methods for printing ints, doubles, etc. to the log.
  * Cleaned up some pulpcore.js issues found by JSLint.
  
0.9 b216 (August 23, 2007)
  * Examples: Added BubbleMark
  * Documentation: The platform implementation Javadocs are no longer included in the distribution 
    archive. 
  * Fixed Bug: Tweaked BufferStrategy usage for Mac OS X. Animations previously appeared jerky in 
    some situations.

    Int arguments were listened to for changes)
  * Fixed Bug: Added null check for ImageSprite(CoreImage image) constructor.
  * Fixed Bug: Fixed range of CoreMath.rand(int, int). 
    CoreMath.rand(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE) now works correctly.
  * Tests: Added some unit tests (in Subversion repository)
  * API: Removed CoreMath.log() and CoreMath.exp() due to inaccuracy. CoreMath.pow() was also 
    removed because it depends on log() and exp().
  * API: Added CoreApplet.getCurrentScene() for convenient access from JavaScript.
  * API: Added Stage.getActualFrameRate() to programmatically access the displayed frame rate.
    
0.9 b215 (July 4, 2007)

  * API: Fixed typo in the API of the Sprite scale() and scaleTo() methods.
  * API: Added constructors to each Sprite subclass to take doubles as parameters.
  * API: Removed several public methods that took a float as a parameter when there was 
    an identical method that took a double as a parameter.
  * API: Removed Scene2D.hasTimelines() (Scene2D.getNumTimelines() is available).
  * API: Renamed Scene2D.clearTimelines() -> Scene2D.removeAllTimelines().
  * Documentation: More Javadocs in Assets and Scene2D.
  
0.9 b210 (June 25, 2007)
  * API: Added CoreSystem.isWindows() and CoreSystem.isWindowsXPorNewer()
  * Fixed Regression: Stage was still creating the Sound Engine even if it was not needed.
  * Fixed Bug: Fixed keyboard focus: Java 5 + Windows XP + Firefox.
  * Fixed Bug: Windows more accuratly hits 60fps, allowing for smoother animation. These
    issues were focused on:
    - More accurate sleep() function. This fix may need a change in Java 1.7 - keep watch of bug 
      6435126. http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6435126
    - Changed Platform.sleepUntilTimeMillis() to Platform.sleepUntilTimeMicros();
