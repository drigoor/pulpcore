0.10.9 (December 14, 2007)
  * Examples: Project template now contains more scenes
  * Examples: Added SceneGraph example (fractal tree).
  * Examples: Removed Scenes example (see Project template)
  * Examples: Removed MultiThreaded example (moved example to JavaDoc)
  * API: Added to Group: moveToTop(), moveToBottom(), moveUp(), moveDown().
  * API: Added Assets.getAsStream().
  * API: Added Label.createMultilineLabel() convenience functions.
  * API: Added Input.isMouseMoving() to 
  * Core: Retroweaver is now a normal part of the build process in the templates and examples.
    For now, PulpCore itself still uses Java 1.4 code, just in case there are any problems with 
    Retroweaver. All the examples now use Java 5 language features and have been tested to run
    fine with Java 1.4.
  * Fixed bug: another centering anchoring issue.
  * Fixed bug: Surface is now correctly redrawn if another OS window was on top of it (occured 
    on Java 6 + Windows when the Scene had no dirty rectangles).
  * Fixed bug: ImageSprite now correctly detects if its AnimatedImage changed frames.
  * Fixed bug: missing a dirty rectangle if a sprite is removed from a Group, added to the same
    Group, and moved its position all in the same frame.
  * Fixed bug: Font creator had a ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if monospace.numerals was true but 
    the font contained no numerals.
    
0.10.8 (December 4, 2007)
  * Examples: Added Text example, showing text animation, word wrapping, accent chars, etc.
  * Tools: Font creator now uses GlyphMetrics for each character's left-side bearing and right-side 
    bearing. This means special accent chars are drawn correctly, and fonts looks better overall. 
  * Tools: The font properties "kerning.left.*" and "kerning.right.*" are now named 
    "bearing.left.*" and "bearing.right.*"
  * Core: Font tracking is not applied to special zero-width characters.
  * Core: More accurately hitting the requested frame rate on Windows (reduces, but not eliminates,
    vertical tearing)
  * Fixed bug: Fixed Firefox issue: white flash is no longer shown when the applet first appears.
  * Fixed bug: Fixed timeline bug caused some properties to be incorrectly set when looping.
  * Fixed bug: there was a bug that prevented a 2nd PulpCore applet from loading resources if both
    applets were on a virtual name-based host on Firefox (Windows). This bug was fixed by disabling
    LiveConnect in this situation. (Using LiveConnect created a glitch in the access permissions
    system). Ironically, getAppletContext().showDocument(new URL("javascript: someMethod();"));
    works fine in Firefox and doesn't cause the glitch.
  
0.10.7 (November 21, 2007)
  * Examples: Added Colors example, showing compositing modes.
  * Examples: Added Sketch example, showing traditional graphics function calls (instead of
    managed sprites).
  * Fixed bug: Fixed possible StringIndexOutOfBoundsException if numDisplayChars > text length.
  * Fixed bug: centered anchor was wrong for some fractional-width sprites.
  * API: Added CoreMath.ceil(), renamed CoreMath.intPart() -> CoreMath.floor()
  * API: Added Input.isMouseInside() to check if the mouse is inside the Stage.
  * API: TextField now has a Bool enabled property (like Button).
  * Graphics: optimized rotated rectangle rendering (there is still room for optimization)
  * Graphics: added CoreGraphics.COMPOSITE_MULT.
  * Graphics: drawLine() is now anti-aliased.
  * Graphics: Updated FilledSprite and CoreGraphics to draw filled rectangles at fractional
    locations (previously fractional rectangles were only enabled if the rectangle was rotated).

0.10.6 (November 10, 2007)
  * Documentation: added various JavaDocs here and there.
  * Core: Provided a better Mac OS X Leopard fix (looks better, uses less processor).
  * Core: Better assertions for checking for Group concurrent modification (multi-threaded apps).
  * Fixed Bug: Issue #1
  * Examples: The SoundEffects example now includes a mute button.
  * Tools: Example HTML creator now puts the project name in the title.
  * Tools: Example HTML creator now encodes special characters: & " < >
  
0.10.5 (November 4, 2007)
  * Examples: Added TileMap example
  * Examples: Updated Starfield and Widgets examples
  * Core: provided a workaround for Java 5 on Mac OS X Leopard that dropped every other frame when 
    running at 60fps (Forcing a max of 58fps in this situation).
  * Core: fixed possible ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when scaling down and using fractional
    metrics. (Most users won't notice because this bug was rare and the renderer automatically 
    recovers from errors - PulpCore never stops because of a graphics error).
  * Tools: pulpcore.js now asks the user to restart Firefox if Java 1.3 is installed and the user 
    just installed Java 6 via the XPI.
  * Fixed Bug: Fixed access from JavaScript (LiveConnect) when jars are obfuscated 
    (see BubbleMark example)
  * Fixed Bug: Scene2D rendering error when dirty rectangles is disabled.
  * Fixed Bug: typo in pulpcore.js
  
0.10.4 (October 20, 2007)
  * Fixed Bug: double-clicking an empty TextField caused an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
    (tulsidas).
  * Tools: pulpcore_codebase can be defined for using a different codebase than the default.
    See the "project" template for an example.
  * Tools: pulpcore.js no longer allows Java 1.3 JREs to run PulpCore apps (Firefox issue).
  * Tools: pulpcore.js provides a better Java installation on Firefox.
  * Examples: templates now compile with source and target set to 1.4
  
0.10.3 (October 11, 2007)
  * Fixed Bug: isolated and created a workarounds for JavaSound pop/click bugs on both Mac and
    Windows. For Mac and Windows Java 1.4, the fix requires modifying the output sound, but it's 
    not noticable for most sounds. Another Windows fix - which existed in 0.8 but was incorrectly  
    removed from 0.9 - requires delaying a sound's playback by 10ms. A third fix exists only in
    Windows Java 5 or newer.
  * Applet Platform: sound is now muted gracefully when the app is exited.
  * Core: sound level and pan changes are now interpolated for more natural audio changes.
  * Core: updated default appearance of labeled buttons. See Button.createLabeledButton() and
    Button.createLabeledToggleButton().
  * Tools: PulpCorePlayer is more command-line friendly (setting Main-Class attribute in jar
    manifest) and it can now load PulpCore apps from the internet (only if the <applet> tag is 
    used - it can't load apps that use pulpcore.js)
  * API: TimelineEvent is now a Runnable, so the API is more familiar to Swing/AWT developers.
    Custom TimelineEvents will need to implement run() instead of trigger().
  * API: Added TimelineEvent.hasExecuted()
  * API: Added Scene2D.invokeLater(), invokeAndWait(), and addEventAndWait().
  * API: SoundClip data is now stored in little-endian byte order instead of big-endian. 
    (This only matters to developers doing sound synthesis or using Ogg Vorbis - be sure to get the 
    latest JOrbisAdapter.java in SVN).
  * API: Added TextField constructor: TextField(String text, int x, int y) which automatically 
    chooses a width and height.
  * API: Added Assets.getAssetNames()
  * Examples: Added MultiThreaded example
  
0.10.2 (September 14, 2007)
  * Examples: Added SoundEffects example
  * Tools: New audio formats: mono and stereo, 8000Hz, 11025Hz, 22050Hz, 44100Hz. WAV and AU
    file formats are supported. OGG is also supported if you have the jars (see the Wiki for info)
  * API: Added SoundSequence to play a sequence of sounds togther.
  * API: Both SoundClip and SoundSequence now extend the Sound base class. 
  * API: Added Sound.play(level, pan) to pan a sound clip.

0.10.1 (September 8, 2007)
  * Examples: Added Starfield example to demo mouse wheel rotation
  * Examples: All examples now have the default dimensions of 640x480.
  * API: Removed Group.commitChanges() (it was required in some circumstances, but using it
         was counter-intuitive, so the underlying algorithm was changed).
  * API: Added Input.getMouseWheelRotation(), Input.getMouseWheelX(), Input.getMouseWheelY(), and
         Sprite.isMouseWheelRotated()
  * API: Renamed:
         Stage.gotoInterruptedScene() -> Stage.popScene()
	 Stage.interruptScene() -> Stage.pushScene()
	 Stage.isInterrupted() -> Stage.canPopScene()
  * API: Added Stage.replaceScene() (sets the scene without clearing the scene stack)
  * Fixed Bug: possible NPE in Label if text is null.
  * Fixed Bug: Scene2D now saves the cursor state on hide.
  * Applet platform: Input.CURSOR_OFF now works.
  * Applet platform: distiction between left and right Alt, Shift, Control, and Meta keys.
  * Applet platform: distiction between mouse button 1, 2, and 3.
  * Applet platform: Added "Get Java" message for Java 1.3 or older.
  * Applet platform: Removed Java 1.1 classes ImageProducerScene, SunAudio, CoreAppletBeanInfo,  
    CoreApplet$COMClassObject.
  * Core: Now using the Java Collections framework (instead of Vector, Stack, Hashtable, and 
    Enumeration).
  * Core: Default font now has monospace numerals
  * Core: Changed version number to 0.10
  
  
== Version 0.9 (the last Java 1.1 compatible release) ==
  

0.9 b218 (September 4, 2007)
  * Examples: Example jar files in distribution archive are obfuscated - this brings the jar of 
    each example from 200K+ to about 84K. The total size of the distribution archive shrinks by 
    about 900K.
  * API: TextField.selectAll() is now public.
  * Player: CoreSystem.showDocument() now works under PulpCorePlayer.
  * Player: PulpCorePlayer can now open simple HTML files containing an applet tag (for Eclipse).
  * Player: PulpCorePlayer now has a File->Reload command. Tested in Eclipse Europa, 
    NetBeans 6, and jEdit 4.3/AntFarm 1.5. 
  * Fixed Bug: CoreSystem.print(Object)
  
0.9 b217 (September 1, 2007)
  * Examples: BubbleMark test now caps the frame rate by default.
  * Examples: build files can now optionally use applet parameters.
  * Examples: "project" template now accepts library jars in the lib folder.
  * API: Prevent instantiation of static classes Base64, CoreMath, PNGWriter, and StringUtil.
  * API: TextField.setText() is now public.
  * API: Added CoreSystem.getAppProperty() for applet parameters. Also the PulpCorePlayer and
    applet HTML generator were updated to accomodate. See the project template for an example.

  * Cleaned up some pulpcore.js issues found by JSLint.
  
0.9 b216 (August 23, 2007)
  * Examples: Added BubbleMark
  * Documentation: The platform implementation Javadocs are no longer included in the distribution 
    archive. 
  * Fixed Bug: Tweaked BufferStrategy usage for Mac OS X. Animations previously appeared jerky in 
    some situations.
  * Fixed Bug: Labels are now updated if any of its Property arguments change. (Previously, only
    Int arguments were listened to for changes)
  * Fixed Bug: Added null check for ImageSprite(CoreImage image) constructor.
  * Fixed Bug: Fixed range of CoreMath.rand(int, int). 
    CoreMath.rand(Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE) now works correctly.
  * Tests: Added some unit tests (in Subversion repository)
  * API: Removed CoreMath.log() and CoreMath.exp() due to inaccuracy. CoreMath.pow() was also 
    removed because it depends on log() and exp().
  * API: Added CoreApplet.getCurrentScene() for convenient access from JavaScript.
  * API: Added Stage.getActualFrameRate() to programmatically access the displayed frame rate.
    
0.9 b215 (July 4, 2007)
  * Examples: updated the Widgets example to show transformed widgets.
  * Fixed Bug: Timelines didn't properly accept startDelay as a parameter in its constructor.
  * Fixed Bug: Audio popping in Mac OS X.

  * API: Fixed typo in the API of the Sprite scale() and scaleTo() methods.
  * API: Added constructors to each Sprite subclass to take doubles as parameters.
  * API: Removed several public methods that took a float as a parameter when there was 
    an identical method that took a double as a parameter.
  * API: Removed Scene2D.hasTimelines() (Scene2D.getNumTimelines() is available).
  * API: Renamed Scene2D.clearTimelines() -> Scene2D.removeAllTimelines().
  * Documentation: More Javadocs in Assets and Scene2D.
  
0.9 b210 (June 25, 2007)
  * API: Added CoreSystem.isWindows() and CoreSystem.isWindowsXPorNewer()
  * Fixed Regression: Stage was still creating the Sound Engine even if it was not needed.
  * Fixed Bug: Fixed keyboard focus: Java 5 + Windows XP + Firefox.
  * Fixed Bug: Windows more accuratly hits 60fps, allowing for smoother animation. These
    issues were focused on:
    - More accurate sleep() function. This fix may need a change in Java 1.7 - keep watch of bug 
      6435126. http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6435126
    - Changed Platform.sleepUntilTimeMillis() to Platform.sleepUntilTimeMicros();
