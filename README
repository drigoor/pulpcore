Quick Start:
1. Get Java 6 and Apache Ant 1.7
2. Run the Ant build file at /templates/quick/build.xml

There are two templates: Quick, and Project.
* The Quick template is designed to create simple PulpCore apps quickly. 
  It is the same template used for the examples.
* The Project template is designed for larger projects.
  It is the same template used for the games at www.pulpgames.net.

To make your own Quick projects, put your Java source files, PNGs, JPEGs,
and WAV files in /templates/quick/src/ and then run the Ant build file.
    
Note: WAV format must be 16-bit, signed, mono or stereo, with a 
sample rate of 8000Hz, 11025Hz, 22050Hz, or 44100Hz. 
Using OGG audio files is possible - see the Wiki for details.
